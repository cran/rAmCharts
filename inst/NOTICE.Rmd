## About the licences

### Free even for commercial use (package version)

    You can download and use all amCharts products for free. The only limitation of the free
    version is that a small link to this web site will be displayed in the top left corner of
    your charts. If you would like to use charts without this link, or you appreciate the
    software and would like to support its creators, please purchase a commercial license at
    [https://www.amcharts.com/online-store/][amcharts_store].

### Single website license

    If you have a public website (no signup is necessary), or you’re a web developer who is
    developing a website for a client and want to add charting or mapping capabilities to it,
    Single website license will do. The license is also good if your site spans several
    physical servers or sub-domains.

 
### Multiple websites license

    This license type is good if you have several public websites that you want to add our
    libraries to. By acquiring Multiple websites license you will avoid the need to purchase a
    Single website license for each of your sites separately. It’s also very convenient license
    type for web developers who want to use amCharts stuff in multiple projects for their
    clients. No additional licenses will need to be acquired for your clients. However, this
    license does not give right to redistribute a standalone version of the libraries OR bundle
    them as part of the redistributable software package such as CMS.

 
### OEM SaaS license

    The ultimate in licenses. In additional to allowing you to freely use the library in all
    websites that are owned or developed by you, it also gives the right to redistribute them
    as part of other software such as CMS, BI or Intranet applications. It is also the only
    license type that includes full source code for the product it was purchased for.
    One thing to note about SaaS (Software as a Service).
    If you’re not certain whether your website is
    SaaS or not, use this rule of thumb: if your users need a subscription (paid ir free) to
    access parts of the site that relies on our libraries, we consider it an SaaS scenario. If
    you’re still not sure which license type to choose, please contact us – we’ll help you to
    figure that out.
